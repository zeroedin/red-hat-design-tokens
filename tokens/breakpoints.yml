        When a viewport increases in size, visual elements may also increase in size, change layout, and 
        adapt to compensate for the increase in screen real estate, Using mobile first, responsive design
        approach our goal is to apply minimum styles to make a layout work at the smallest breakpoint.

        The breakpoint token values represent the **minimum**
        [CSS pixel](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSS_pixel) width of a device's
        screen, corresponding to the `min-width` media query so for example a device with a
        viewport greater than the `--rh-breakpoint-small` token is considered equivalent to a mobile
        device in landscape mode, whereas a device with a screen width less than the
        `--rh-breakpoint-small` token is considered a equivalent to a mobile device in portrait mode.

        Since CSS currently does not allow custom properties in media queries, these tokens must be
        uses in preprocessors or templating systems, or imported into JavaScript modules. We
        recommend against importing these token values directly into components. In Red Hat's
        Design System, we import them into a
        [reactive controller](https://lit.dev/docs/composition/controllers/) which exposes
        information about the screen size through a JavaScript API.
